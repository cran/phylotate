phylotate v1.3 (Release date: 2019-06-29)
=========================================

  * Added "newick.named" format specified for writing and printing, to
    generate Newick data files with named instead of numbered nodes.

phylotate v1.2 (Release date: 2018-01-30)
=========================================

  * Added mb_attrs() function for extracting MrBayes attributes in
    tabular form, suitable for binding for use with ggtree.

phylotate v1.1 (Release date: 2017-04-24)
=========================================

  * Made the Newick parser more tolerant, so that it doesn't choke on
    files ending with semicolons or files with distance values attached
    to the root node. Files produced by RAxML should now be parsed
    correctly.
