phylotate v1.1 (Release date: 2017-04-24)
=========================================

  * Made the Newick parser more tolerant, so that it doesn't choke on
    files ending with semicolons or files with distance values attached
    to the root node. Files produced by RAxML should now be parsed
    correctly.
